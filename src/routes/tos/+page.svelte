    <h1>Guidelines</h1>
    <i>As of October 22 2023</i>
    <p>
        1. <b>Have common sense</b>: Don't be toxic, harass other users, or be a general nuisance. 
        It is suggested that users first try to resolve trolls on their own behalf or ignore them,
        but accounts created <i>exclusively</i> for harassment will be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <b>Don't violate ToS of any services or American law</b>: Some
        guidelines (i.e. <b>13+ age limit</b>) need to be enforced to ensure that
        NeoZXW can stay alive into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. <b>Political and heated topics</b>: This isn't the place for political discourse, heated or not. 
    </p>
    <p>
        4. <b>Maturity level</b>: Do not post NSFW or lewd content.
    </p>
